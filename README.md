# VRSimTk
### Virtual Reality Simulation Toolkit for Unity
**Requires Unity 5.5.3 or higher.**

This project aims to provide a framework for the development of Virtual Environments, able to interoperate with data coming from decoupled simulations.
Currently an XML data exchange module has been developed, but the final goal is to have a framework for the development of other *connectors*.

**This is a work-in-progress, see the [*WIP* branch](https://github.com/gpvigano/VRSimTk/tree/WIP).**
